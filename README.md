**DO NOT JUDGE MY ENGLISH, I AM LEARNING**

i do not if package.json it is clear. so with the line below you can run the project:

> **npm run install**\n
> **npm run electron-dev**

This is my first frontend project although i like backend so much.
It was a high school project for my sister and works for me to my cv.

I pretended to make something primitive _"game"_ of drag and select elements
with math or language tematic.

The site is full static, it has not database connection to request resources. To the future
maybe i will make a login system for the anecdote.
